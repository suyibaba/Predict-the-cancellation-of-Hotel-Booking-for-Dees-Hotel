    <h1>Hotel Booking Cancellation Analysis</h1>
    
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>For this project, we analyzed data on hotel bookings and cancellations to identify patterns and factors that contribute to cancellations. Our goal was to help hotel managers better understand why cancellations occur and how they can prevent them.</p>
    
    <h2>Data Set</h2>
    <p>We used a data set from a large hotel chain that included information on bookings made at their hotels over a two-year period. The data set included information on the booking date, the hotel, the type of room, the length of stay, and whether the booking was cancelled or not. We also had access to demographic information on the guests, such as their age, gender, and country of origin.</p>
    
    <h2>Analysis</h2>
    <p>Our analysis focused on identifying patterns and factors that contribute to cancellations. We used a combination of statistical analysis and data visualization to identify correlations between different factors and cancellations. We also used machine learning algorithms to predict which bookings were most likely to be cancelled based on the available data.</p>
    
    <h2>Results</h2>
    <p>Our analysis identified several factors that contribute to cancellations, including the time of year, the length of stay, and the type of room booked. We also found that cancellations were more likely for bookings made by guests from certain countries or age groups. Our machine learning models were able to predict cancellations with a high degree of accuracy, which could be used to help hotel managers proactively address potential cancellations.</p>
    
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>By analyzing data on hotel bookings and cancellations, we were able to identify patterns and factors that contribute to cancellations. Our findings can be used by hotel managers to better understand why cancellations occur and how they can prevent them. We also identified areas for further research, such as analyzing the impact of marketing campaigns or promotions on cancellations.</p>
